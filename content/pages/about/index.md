### About me
<p>
nurulmac11 is my first nickname on the internet. It was simply one of the email address suggestions of hotmail when I
was 11. So, hotmail combined my name, lastname and age and generated this username.
I liked this username, and I am using it since then.
</p>

<p>
So, my name is Nurullah Macun. I am from Manisa and living in Ankara. I am coding since my childhood. I started coding 
websites using free website tools (namely, tr.gg, I guess it's still active?) at about 2008 and met with html, css. 
I would like to share webarchive snapshot of that website, but I am a bit embarrassed :D 
I even remember asking my parents to if I can open a website using this tool 
because I was a child and afraid of I need to pay some extra internet bill etc. 
</p>

<p>
At high school years, I met with php. I remember that oop was pretty new for php in those years. 
So, I met with algorithmic thinking first time, like a basic syntax of a programming language, if, else, for etc.
I continued to code websites using php. After coding several websites just for fun with vanilla php, css, I learned about frameworks.
Then, I met with codeigniter, bootstrap and coded several websites with those too.</p>

<p>
At college years, I met with python and love it. It was so simple and easy to learn, code and love. 
Since then, I am using python for everything, mainly web coding. I coded several websites using django, django rest framework.
I learned basics of REST api. At some point, I met with vue.js and it was my first javascript framework for frontend.
So, I had gained experience with frontend coding also.
</p>

<p>
At my professional working years, I continued to work in similar tech stacks, which is python, 
django on the backend side and react.js on the frontend. Mostly, I worked at the startups, 
so I find a chance to touch each part of web development not only backend.
</p>

<p>
Besides from coding, here are some other parts of me. You can check;</p>
